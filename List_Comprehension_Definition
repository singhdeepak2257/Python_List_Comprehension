#List comprehension offers a shorter syntax when you want to create a new list based on the values of an existing list.

#The Syntax
#newlist = [expression for item in iterable if condition == True]
#The return value is a new list, leaving the old list unchanged.

fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "kiwi", "mango"]
newlist = [x for x in fruits if "a" in x]
print(newlist)
